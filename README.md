# Name Analysis

## Background

When I was at university, I had a friend - and that friend had a very peculiar property. His name contained no repeating characters. I won't include his full name here to maintain his privacy, but his name was a stonking 12 letters long. That's quite a lot not to have any repeating characters.

Now, I have another friend. This friend is a mathematician. I was telling him this story, and we got to pondering other possible names that didn't have any repeating characters. What is the longest name without a repeating character? How many people have names without repeating characters? The following investigation is dedicated to these two friends.

## The Names

In order to investigate names without repeating characters, first we'll need a list of names. An initial guess was whether or not we could use the UK electoral register, though after a quick look this does not seem to be readily available online - online via public libraries. Historical records are also available, though cost a princely sum of Â£92. The search for names continued. I came across a few other name datasets, but these seemed to only contain first names.

Eventually, I did stumble across [this dataset](https://github.com/Debdut/names.io) which contains lists of first and last names. These will be the datasets used to carry out the investigation.
